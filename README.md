# Cancer-detection-model
This project implements a neural network model for cancer detection using TensorFlow, trained on a dataset containing features related to cancer patients and their diagnosis. It provides a simple yet effective tool for predicting cancer diagnosis based on patient data.

# Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python (>=3.6)
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    TensorFlow (>=2.0)


# Installation

  Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Himani2615/cancer-detection-model

# Usage

 1. Data Preparation:
      Ensure your dataset is in CSV format.
      Make sure to have a column named "diagnosis(1=m, 0=b)" for the target variable.

 2. Run the Model:
    Execute the provided Python script cancer_detection.py to train and evaluate the model.

        python cancer_detection.py

 3. Predicting on New Data:
    Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict cancer on new similar datasets. Follow these steps:
        Load your new dataset (in CSV format).
        Preprocess the data similar to the training data (e.g., handle missing values, scale features).
        Use the trained model to predict cancer diagnosis for the new data.

# Example Code

    import pandas as pd
    import tensorflow as tf

    # Load dataset
    dataset = pd.read_csv("new_data.csv")
    x_new = dataset.drop(columns=["diagnosis(1=m, 0=b)"])

    # Load the trained model
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model("cancer_detection_model.h5")

    # Predict on new data
    predictions = model.predict(x_new)
Ensure to replace "new_data.csv" with the path to your new dataset file. After executing this code, predictions will contain the predicted values for cancer diagnosis for the new data.

# Further Instructions

To adapt this model for predicting cancer on new similar data, follow these guidelines:

   Ensure the new dataset has the same features as the training dataset.
   Preprocess the new data similarly to the training data (e.g., handle missing values, scale features).
   Load the trained model using tf.keras.models.load_model.
   Use the loaded model to predict on the new data.

By following these steps, you can utilize the trained model for predicting cancer diagnosis on new datasets with similar features.
